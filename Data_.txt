Based on the definition of our problem, factors that may impact our decision are:
  * Demographic information, e.g. population, density, education, age, income
  * Number of existing shopping malls in the neighborhood and nearby
  * Number of existing movie theaters in the neighborhood and nearby
We decided to use a regularly spaced grid of locations all around the whole Montreal island, to define our neighborhoods. Concretely, we will use popular hexagon honeycomb to define our neighborhoods.
In this project, we will fetch or extract data from the following data sources:
  * Montreal census information of the 2016 year
  * Centers of hexagon neighborhoods will be generated algorithmically and approximate addresses of     centers of those areas will be obtained using Google Geocoding API
  * Shopping malls and movie theaters data in every neighborhood will be obtained using Foursquare     API
  * Coordinate of Montreal center will be obtained using Google Geocoding API of well known     Montreal location
  * Montreal borough shapefile is obtained from Carto
 Montreal Island Shape File
To show the Montreal island boundary in the folium map, we need a geojson definition file for Montreal island. We downloaded this shapefile from the Carto website.
The file is in JSON format, containing boundary definition for every borough or municipality in Montreal island.
