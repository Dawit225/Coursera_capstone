In this project, we are going to look for an optimal location to open a movie theater. 
Specifically, this report can provide a reference for stakeholders who are interested in opening 
a movie theater in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.Montreal is the second-largest city in Canada and 
the largest city in the province of Quebec, located along the Saint Lawrence River at its 
junction with the Ottawa River. It sits on an island. In this report, we will focus on all 
areas on the Montreal island. There are many movie theaters on Montreal island, we will conclude where are the existing movie theaters. 
Then we will use a clustering model to find similar areas on the island considering demographic data of each borough and region. 
The preferred area shall be distant from existing movie theaters.
We will use data science tools to fetch the raw data, visualize it then generate a few most promising areas based on the above criteria.
In the meanwhile, we will also explain the advantage and traits for the candidates, so that stakeholders can make the final decision base on the analysis.
